I've written a bit about my look at "commercial off-the-shelf" USB3 PHY boards; and have been
taking a look recently at the [Design Gateway AB07-USBFMC module](https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Design-Gateway/AB07-USB3FMC?qs=5aG0NVq1C4wWGaHs8Oqcww%3D%3D). It turns out that my unit has what seems to be a pretty
embarrassing defect.

I've been testing my in-progress USB3 gateware with this PHY; and I've been running into an
interesting issue: periodically, some of the raw values sent were off by a single bit.

When training a USB3 link, one of the data sequences exchanged looks like this:

```sh
BC BC BC BC 00 00 4A 4A 
4A 4A 4A 4A 4A 4A 4A 4A 
```

When using the AB07-USBFMC, trying to send this pattern resulted in the following:

```sh
BC BC BC BC 00 00 0A 4A
0A 4A 0A 4A 0A 4A 0A 4A
```

This is interesting for two reasons:

  * This PHY has geared inputs, and accepts two bytes of data at a time.
  * The incorrect values (`0A`) are off from the correct value (`4A`) by a single bit.

Sure enough, modifying the data packet to send `FF` instead of `4A` pretty clearly shows off that missing bit:

```sh
BC BC BC BC 00 00 BF FF
BF FF BF FF BF FF BF FF
```

At this point, I assumed that I'd gotten the pinout incorrect; and that I'd been writing to the wrong pin --
but careful examination of the documentation and my FPGA I/O definitions suggested that I had things right.
This suggested it was time to check things on the physical layer.

The board in question looks like this:

{{< figure src="/post-media/ab07-usb3fmc-wtf/board.jpg" 
    title="The AB07-USBFMC (slightly modified as detailed later)."
    alt="The PHY board, which features a notable long span of resistors, neatly tucked in parallel." >}}

Notably, there's a long series of what look like termination / signal conditioning resistors present at
the PHY boundary -- and it looks like there's about 32 in total; which would make sense: 16 for transmit,
and 16 for receive.

A quick probe verifies that these are ~50R resistors, which would make a lot of sense for series termination:

    title="Sure looks like a series termination resistor."
    alt="Multimeter showing a measurement of 47.5 ohms." >}}


This is excellent news, as it means that the signals are easily accessible without "voiding our warranty",
which is a bit of a comfort when dealing with a rather expensive evaluation board.

So, as a next-step test, I had my FPGA squirt a 100MHz clock signal into every line on the transmit bus,
and probed the PHY side of one of those termination resistors:

{{< figure src="/post-media/ab07-usb3fmc-wtf/phy_tx_healthy.png" 
    title="A nice, healthy wobble. AC coupled."
    alt="A somewhat-rounded square wave, consistent with probing a 100MHz clock." >}}

The frequency and amplitude of this signal are pretty in-line with what you'd expect: the amplitude corresponds
nicely to a decently healthy logic `1`. But how does the signal look on the problematic bit?

I adjusted the FPGA design so it only squirted a wave into the problematic bit; and probed in line until I found it:

{{< figure src="/post-media/ab07-usb3fmc-wtf/phy_tx_unhealthy.png" 
    title="A *lot* less happy. Still AC couled for display."
    alt="A somewhat-rounded square wave, consistent with probing a 100MHz clock." >}}

Ut-oh. This signal's looking a lot less happy -- and a lot more attenuated. At approximately 500mV peak,
you'd be hard pressed to consider this a logic `1`, even if you gave it your very best squint. There's no way
this thing would have worked in a test environment -- which makes it seem very unlikely that this board was, y'know, 
tested.

This immediately made me suspicious of the termination resistor sitting next to it; and apparently for good reason:

{{< figure src="/post-media/ab07-usb3fmc-wtf/larger_50r.jpg" 
    title="Quite possibly the largest 50 立 I've ever seen."
    alt="Multimeter showing a measurement of 396.0 ohms." >}}

This resistor is quite clearly supposed to be 50 立. It's also quite clearly *not* 50 立, despite sitting cleanly
in the middle of a row of 50 立 resistors, and pretty much definitely the source of my problems.

So, naturally it's time to perform what I assume must be several hundred dollars worth of rework on this $1.65k board. 
Luckily, I stock E24 0402s, so I had the resistor replaced with an appropriate value in no time.

{{< figure src="/post-media/ab07-usb3fmc-wtf/happier.png" 
    title="Much happier. Note the amplitude."
    alt="Oscilloscope display of a corrected waveform." >}}

With an appropriate value replaced, everything looks much happier -- and everything works much more nicely.
Finally, our USB training sets look just the way they should:

{{< figure src="/post-media/ab07-usb3fmc-wtf/yay.png" 
    title="A correct Training Set, at last."
    alt="Analyzer display showing the correct value of our training set." >}}

I'm planning on reaching out to Design Gateway -- to at least let them know that this is an issue on some boards.
I'll update this post if/when I get a reply.
