      <description>If you&#39;re looking to play with commercial USB3 PHY evaluation hardware &amp;ndash; that is, if you&#39;re looking to get a board someone else has designed and built, rather than soldering up your own or experimenting with 5G SerDes &amp;ndash; there seem to be two options available: the HiTech Global FMC_USB3 ($795 USD), or the Design Gateway AB07-USBFMC ($1,650 USD).
  The USB3FMC sitting atop the Digilent Nexys Video FPGA board   Thanks to Tim Ansell, I&#39;ve been able to get my hands on the AB07-USBFMC; this quick post summarizes my findings so far working with the board.</description>

      <description>This post is a summary of the findings from my look at using the ECP5 SerDes for USB3 LFPS for quick reference of how to use the ECP5 SerDes semi-documented out-of-band I/O features.
Quick summary:
 In addition to using the ECP5&#39;s SerDes pins to drive the SerDes; the SerDes Tx/Rx pins can also be used as Low-Data-Rate (LDR) outputs/inputs while the SerDes is in use. This is intended to allow transmission/receipt of out-of-band signals in addition to normal SerDes operation; and thus requires a configured SerDes.</description>

      <title>USB3 LFPS Using ECP5 SerDes I/O</title>

      <description>Lately, I&#39;ve been developing a USB3 stack, and a USB3 frontend using the ECP5 SerDes. The ECP5 SerDes seems almost perfect for USB3, which shares many of its implementation details with PCIe. However, there are a couple of hitches.
The more difficult to deal with is support for USB3&#39;s Low Frequency Periodic Signaling (LFPS). LFPS carries small bursts of information via a slow, out-of-band signal, meant to be used before the high-speed USB3 link is established:</description>
