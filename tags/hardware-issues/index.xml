      <description>I&#39;ve written a bit about my look at &amp;ldquo;commercial off-the-shelf&amp;rdquo; USB3 PHY boards; and have been taking a look recently at the Design Gateway AB07-USBFMC module. It turns out that my unit has what seems to be a pretty embarrassing defect.
I&#39;ve been testing my in-progress USB3 gateware with this PHY; and I&#39;ve been running into an interesting issue: periodically, some of the raw values sent were off by a single bit.</description>

      <description>If you&#39;re looking to play with commercial USB3 PHY evaluation hardware &amp;ndash; that is, if you&#39;re looking to get a board someone else has designed and built, rather than soldering up your own or experimenting with 5G SerDes &amp;ndash; there seem to be two options available: the HiTech Global FMC_USB3 ($795 USD), or the Design Gateway AB07-USBFMC ($1,650 USD).
  The USB3FMC sitting atop the Digilent Nexys Video FPGA board   Thanks to Tim Ansell, I&#39;ve been able to get my hands on the AB07-USBFMC; this quick post summarizes my findings so far working with the board.</description>
